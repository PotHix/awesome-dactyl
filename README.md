[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

This is a curated list of dactyl-like keyboards for those who think concave
keyboards are the best.

## Models

This list split all dactyl-like keyboads by their inspiration. Most (if not
all) of them have an inspiration on dactyl, but if they got inspiration from a
different keyboard as well, it will be added to this keyboard category.

The categorization is done mostly by appearance and user experience.
