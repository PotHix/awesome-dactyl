[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

This is a curated list of dactyl-like keyboards for those who think concave
keyboards are the best.

[TL;DR: It's a curated list of links to help you build beautiful keyboards like these üòç](#how-it-looks-like)

## Models

This list split all dactyl-like keyboads by their inspiration. Most (if not
all) of them have an inspiration on the origial dactyl, but there are many
forks adapting it to use parts from other keyboards as well. They a secondary
inspiration is found, we will use it as a priority (since this repository is
already about dactyl üòõ)
